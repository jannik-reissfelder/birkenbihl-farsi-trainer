description: Loads architectural context from docs/ folder to inform development decisions
---

# Read Documentation

## Objective
Internalize current architecture, patterns, and constraints from docs/ folder to ensure new work aligns with existing design.

## Process

1. **Load Core Architecture**
   Read and absorb key architectural documents in folder docs/:
   - System design and component relationships
   - Data models and schemas
   - API contracts and interfaces
   - Migration strategies and constraints

2. **Identify Relevant Patterns**
   Note coding standards, naming conventions, and design patterns in use.

3. **Flag Dependencies**
   Identify critical dependencies or areas that require careful handling.

## Output
Ready to develop with full understanding of:
- How new code should integrate with existing architecture
- What patterns and standards to follow
- What constraints or dependencies to respect

Do not summarize docs back to user unless asked. This is for internal context only.
