# Update Documentation

## Objective
Ensure documentation in folder docs/ accurately reflects the current state of the architecture, key components, and recent changes.

## Process

1. **Scan Current State**
   Review recent commits, changed files, and architecture patterns in the codebase.

2. **Identify Documentation Gaps**
   Compare current implementation against docs/ folder. Flag outdated sections or missing details.

3. **Update Documentation**
   Revise docs/ to match reality:
   - Architecture diagrams and descriptions
   - Key components and their interactions
   - Recent changes or refactors
   - Migration steps if applicable

4. **Verify Consistency**
   Ensure all docs in docs/ are coherent and cross-references are valid.

## Output
Updated documentation files ready to commit.
